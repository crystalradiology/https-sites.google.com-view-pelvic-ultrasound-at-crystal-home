At Crystal Radiology, we provide Pelvic Ultrasound services to help diagnose and monitor various health conditions related to the reproductive and urinary organs. A pelvic ultrasound is a safe, non-invasive diagnostic tool that offers valuable insights into a patientâ€™s internal health, allowing doctors to detect abnormalities, assess organ function, and guide treatment decisions.
This article, explores what a pelvic ultrasound is, why it is required, the different types of ultrasound, conditions it can diagnose, and what to expect during the procedure.

What is a Pelvic Ultrasound?
A pelvic ultrasound is a medical imaging procedure used to examine the internal organs in the pelvic region, including:
âœ” Urinary bladder
âœ” Urethra
âœ” Ovaries
âœ” Uterus
âœ” Fallopian tubes
Unlike X-rays, Pelvic Ultrasound in Crystal Radiology uses sound waves to create images of soft tissues, making it an ideal method for assessing pelvic health without exposure to radiation.

Why is a Pelvic Ultrasound Required?
Doctors may recommend a pelvic ultrasound for various reasons, including:
âœ… Evaluating the structure of the ovaries
âœ… Detecting fluid accumulation in the pelvic area
âœ… Checking for soft tissue abnormalities
âœ… Assessing the size and shape of pelvic organs
âœ… Identifying conditions like cysts, tumors, and fibroids
Since it provides detailed imaging of internal organs, a pelvic ultrasound is an essential tool for diagnosing and monitoring gynecological and urinary conditions.

Types of Pelvic Ultrasounds
Pelvic ultrasounds can be performed using two primary techniques:
1. Transabdominal Ultrasound
ðŸ”¹ The ultrasound transducer (probe) is moved over the lower abdomen.
ðŸ”¹ A conductive gel is applied to ensure clear images.
ðŸ”¹ Provides a broad view of the pelvic organs.
ðŸ”¹ Requires a full bladder for better imaging.
2. Transvaginal Ultrasound
ðŸ”¹ The ultrasound probe is inserted into the vagina for a more detailed internal view.
ðŸ”¹ This method is preferred for evaluating the uterus, ovaries, and cervix.
ðŸ”¹ The probe is covered with a lubricated sheath and gently moved for better imaging.
ðŸ”¹ Provides clearer images than a transabdominal scan.
Both methods are safe and non-invasive, with minimal discomfort. The choice between them depends on the specific medical concern being investigated.

Why Would You Need a Pelvic Ultrasound?
A Pelvic Ultrasound in Crystal Radiology is used for both diagnostic and treatment purposes. It helps in:
âœ… Measuring and evaluating pelvic organs â€“ Size, shape, thickness, and positioning of the uterus, ovaries, and bladder.
âœ… Assessing blood flow â€“ Helps detect circulatory issues within pelvic organs.
âœ… Detecting abnormalities â€“ Identifies masses, fluid collections, or cysts in the pelvic region.
âœ… Guiding procedures â€“ Assists in endometrial biopsies and fertility treatments.

Conditions That Can Be Diagnosed and Treated
Pelvic ultrasound plays a critical role in diagnosing and managing numerous conditions, including:
â€¢	Uterine Abnormalities â€“ Endometrial disorders, polyps, and fibroids.
â€¢	Ovarian Conditions â€“ Cysts, tumors, and monitoring ovarian follicle development. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) â€“ Signs of infection and inflammation.
â€¢	Postmenopausal Bleeding â€“ Evaluates potential causes of abnormal bleeding.
â€¢	Infertility Evaluations â€“ Monitors ovarian follicles and egg retrieval for in vitro fertilization (IVF).
â€¢	Ectopic Pregnancy â€“ Confirms pregnancies occurring outside the uterus.
â€¢	Monitoring Pregnancy and Fetal Health â€“ Tracks fetal growth and detects complications.
â€¢	IUD Positioning â€“ Checks if an intrauterine contraceptive device is correctly placed.
Early detection of these conditions allows for timely treatment, reducing the risk of complications.

How is a Pelvic Ultrasound Performed?
A Pelvic Ultrasound in Crystal Radiology is a quick and painless procedure. However, some preparation is required:
âœ… For a transabdominal ultrasound â€“ A full bladder is needed to improve image clarity. Patients should drink 32 ounces of water an hour before the scan and avoid urinating until the exam is complete.
âœ… For a transvaginal ultrasound â€“ Patients may need to empty their bladder before the procedure for better imaging.
During the scan:
â€¢	The patient lies on an examination table.
â€¢	A gel is applied to the abdomen (for transabdominal scans).
â€¢	The transducer is gently moved over the lower abdomen or inserted into the vagina (for transvaginal scans).
â€¢	The images are displayed in real-time on a video screen.
While the scan is not painful, some patients may feel slight discomfort due to pressure from the probe.
